## This is a script meant for the game 'PLEASE DONATE' on Roblox


```lua
local DisableScriptKey = Enum.KeyCode.LeftControl

repeat task.wait() until game.Loaded
if game.GameId == 3317679266 then
    loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x580x540x43/ScammerList/main/Main.lua"))(DisableScriptKey)

By using this script you do understand that you are breaking Roblox's TOS, which is something we do not condone
Hazem has stated before that if you exploit in his game he doesn't care as long as you aren't harming anyone, but still take this with a grain of salt
